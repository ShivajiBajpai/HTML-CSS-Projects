                        <li class="point1">Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi on November 15, 1989, making him the fifth-youngest player in Test cricket history. He was only 16 years and 205 days old at the time.</li>
                        <li class="point2">Tendulkar was born to a Maharashtrian family on April 24, 1973, at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay. Ramesh Tendulkar, his father, was a well-known Marathi novelist and poet, while Rajni, his mother, worked in the insurance industry. Tendulkar was named after Sachin Dev Burman, Ramesh’s favourite music director.</li>
                        <li class="point3">Throughout his childhood, Sachin was tutored by Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would spend hours in the nets practising. If Achrekar felt fatigued, he would place a one-rupee coin on top of the stumps, which would be given to the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar.</li>
                        <li class="point4">Sachin was a ball boy for the match between India and Zimbabwe at the Wankhede Stadium during the 1987 World Cup. He was 14 at the time. Sachin Tendulkar used to sleep with his cricket gear during his childhood because of his passion for the game.</li>
                        <li class="point5">Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire in 1992 when he was 19 years old. Prior to Tendulkar’s arrival, Yorkshire had never selected anyone from outside the county. </li>
                        <li class="point6">Sachin Tendulkar was the first international batsman to be dismissed by a third umpire. Tendulkar was caught short of the crease by a Jonty Rhodes toss on the second day of the Durban Test in 1992</li>
                        <li class="point7">Tendulkar’s net worth is believed to be around $120 million (US) or 834 crores in Indian rupees (INR). This makes him India’s wealthiest sportsperson. </li>
                        <li class="point8">He started off with 100s in his debut matches in the Ranji, Duleep and Irani Trophies.</li>
                        <li class="point9">Sachin was without a bat contract until the start of the 1996 Cricket World Cup. At the end of the tournament, a famous tyre manufacturer sponsored his willow.</li>
                        <li class="point10">In 2002, Wisden ranked him the second best player ever, after Sir Donald Bradman</li>
